# [Random] Notes From Lectures

## Project related.
Will be using API key from YouTube to generate this project.
Will install small package to make searching process very simple.

User types something in search bar, we'll do an API request to update the list.

We want to know when and what the user is typing into the searchbar (event handling).

## NPM
The flag `--save` with NPM will save the package to our `package.json` file.

## Webpack
Importing && Exporting.

## State

Anytime a state is changed, all the children are re-rendered as well. This can be a very expensive operation.

Change the property state to.... {moar detailz}.
